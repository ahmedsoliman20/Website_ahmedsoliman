Temporary structures are everywhere. They define the outdoor spaces and fill the void between permanent constructions. They follow the organic evolution of cities’ needs and daily functions. Such organic development should be backed by transformable systems that provide flexibility. Transformable structure systems change from one state to another. They can be rapidly assembled and disassembled, then transported to another place to reuse the same materials and reduce the amount of waste.
